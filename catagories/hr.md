# HR

Although the following questions are not DevOps related, they are still quite common and part of the DevOps interview process so it's better to prepare for them as well.

<details>
<summary>Tell us little bit about yourself</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Tell me about your last big project/task you worked on</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was most challenging part in the project you worked on?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why do you want to work here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How did you hear about us?</summary><br><b>

Tell them how did you hear about them :D
Relax, there is no wrong or right answer here...I think.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you describe a good leadership? What makes a good boss for you?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Tell me about a time where you didn't agree on an implementation</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you deal with a situation where key stakeholders are not around and a big decision needs to be made? </summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</summary><br><b>

Some ideas (some of them bad and should not be used):

- Senior DevOps
- Manager
- Retirement
- Your manager
  </b></details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of a time you were able to change the view of a team about a particular tool/project/technology</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever caused a service outage? (or broke a working project, tool, ...?)</summary><br><b>

If you worked in this area for more than 5 years it's hard to imagine the answer would be no. It also doesn't have to be big service outage. Maybe you merged some code that broke a project or its tests. Simply focus on what you learned from such experience.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Rank the following in order 1 to 5, where 1 is most important: salaray, benefits, career, team/people, work life balance</summary><br><b>

You know best your order just have a good thought if you really want to put salary in top or bottom....
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have three important tasks scheduled for today. One is for your boss, second for a colleague who is also a friend, third is for a customer. All tasks are equally important. What do you do first?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have a colleague you donâ€˜t get along with. Tell us some strategies how you create a good work relationship with them anyway.</summary><br><b>

Bad answer: I don't.
Better answer: Every person has strengths and weaknesses. This is true also for colleagues I don't have good work relationship with and this is what helps me to create good work relationship with them. If I am able to highlight or recognize their strengths I'm able to focus mainly on that when communicating with them.

<details>
<summary>What do you love about your work?</summary><br><b>

  </b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are your responsibilities in your current position?</summary><br><b>

You know the best :)
