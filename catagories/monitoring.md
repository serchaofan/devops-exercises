<summary>What is wrong with the old approach of watching for a specific value and trigger an email/phone alert while value is exceeded?</summary><br><b>

This approach require from a human to always check why the value exceeded and how to handle it while today, it is more effective to notify people only when they need to take an actual action.
If the issue doesn't require any human intervention, then the problem can be fixed by some processes running in the relevant environment.
