<summary>What are the differences between Cloud Providers and On-Premise solution?</summary><br><b>

In cloud providers, someone else owns and manages the hardware, hire the relevant infrastructure teams and pays for real-estate (for both hardware and people). You can focus on your business.

In On-Premise solution, it's quite the opposite. You need to take care of hardware, infrastructure teams and pay for everything which can be quite expensive. On the other hand it's tailored to your needs.

<summary>What is Serverless Computing?</summary><br><b>

The main idea behind serverless computing is that you don't need to manage the creation and configuration of server. All you need to focus on is splitting your app into multiple functions which will be triggered by some actions.

It's important to note that:

- Serverless Computing is still using servers. So saying there are no servers in serverless computing is completely wrong
- Serverless Computing allows you to have different paying model. You basically pay only when your functions are running and not when the VM or containers are running as in other payment models
