<summary>What are the advantages of MongoDB? Or in other words, why choosing MongoDB and not other implementation of NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

MongoDB advantages are as followings:

- Schemaless
- Easy to scale-out
- No complex joins
- Structure of a single object is clear

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.

<details>
<summary>In what scenarios would you prefer to use NoSQL/Mongo over SQL?</summary><br><b>

- Heterogeneous data which changes often
- Data consistency and integrity is not top priority
- Best if the database needs to scale rapidly
